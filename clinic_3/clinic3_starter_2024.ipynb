    "\n",
    "a). The split between positive and negative is large. Approximately 93.6% of the people are in good healht, while only around 6.4% is in poor health, leading to a large degree of imbalance within the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "b). The majority class is in good health, while the minority class is in poor health.\n",
    "\n",
    "c). The accuracy of the classifier prediction everybody is not in poor health, i.e. predicting everyone is in good health, is 0.936. The formula of the accuracy $\\frac{TP + TN}{n}$ simplifies in this case to simply $\\frac{TP}{n}$, since it assumes all instances are of the majority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "d). If we were to train our classifier on our dataset and solely use accuracy as an evaluation metric we would see that our model scores very high with even the simplest models, since it would indeed classify most new datapoints correctly as by far the majority of the datapoints fall within the same classification. However, we are interested in evaluating how good the model performs on classifying \"special/minority\" cases within our dataset, in this case the ones in poor health. Therefore, using accuracy as an evaluating metric in this case is not suitable. Additionally, accuracy does not take into account the cost of false negatives or the importance of correctly predicting minority class instances, which is often important within classification tasks."
