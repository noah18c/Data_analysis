    "The Product Safety Alerts page (https://ec.europa.eu/safety-gate-alerts/screen/search?resetSearch=true) of the European Commission (EC) serves as a vital resource for consumers, businesses, and authorities across the European Union (EU). This platform provides up-to-date information on products that pose risks to consumers' health and safety, thereby facilitating prompt action to mitigate potential hazards.\n",

    "Some key features and functions of the Product Safety Alerts page include:\n",

    "**Alert Notifications**: The page regularly publishes alerts regarding unsafe products circulating within the EU market. These alerts cover a wide range of products, including toys, electrical appliances, cosmetics, and household goods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Identification of Risks**: Each alert details the specific risks associated with the identified products, such as potential choking hazards, chemical contamination, or electrical malfunctions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Product Details**: The alerts include information about the product brand, model, and description, enabling consumers to identify and avoid purchasing or using the affected items.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended Actions**: The EC provides guidance on recommended actions for consumers, retailers, and authorities, such as discontinuing product use, recalling items from the market, and implementing corrective measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reporting Mechanisms**: The page offers convenient reporting mechanisms for consumers and businesses to notify authorities about unsafe products or incidents, facilitating swift response and resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Archived Alerts**: Previous alerts remain accessible on the page, allowing users to review historical data and trends related to product safety issues within the EU market.\n",

    "Overall, the Product Safety Alerts page of the EC plays a crucial role in promoting consumer awareness, facilitating product recalls, and safeguarding public health and safety across the European Union. By providing transparent and timely information, this platform empowers stakeholders to take proactive measures to address product safety concerns effectively.\n",

    "1. **Build** a DataFrame from the data (ideally, put all data in this object)\n",
